# Simple-Node.js-OpenAi-Chatbot

Simple node.js web page employing Open AI's "gpt-3.5-turbo" model,

An example of this seemed hard to come by, but then again I am kind of a newb. 

Enjoy, I hope this gets you started on your AI journey.

Will add in various other examples and most likely delve into tuning the responses in the near future.

Additionally even though I have a config.js, it isn't used. But it gives you an idea of how else you could store your api key.

In my case I simply added my key to my environmnet variables on my MAC.

I edited my .zprofile to included the following:



export OPENAI_API_KEY='My key'

this way when I ever I start a new terminal session I am ready to go with my API Key.
